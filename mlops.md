# MLOps at UKHO 



At UKHO, we work on a vast array of data science problems, many of which requiring highly complex and experimental machine learning solutions. 

Over time as we mature as an organisation, we're constantly exploring new ways to strike the balance between rapid experimental progress and robust, repeatable, production-ready code.  

This blog intends to outline what MLOps is to UKHO, what we're doing and we're building towards. 


## What is MLOps? 


It’s a mixture of best practices, procedures, and governance that serve to build trust, reproducibility and continuous rapid improvement to machine learning. But it’s also about fostering a culture, a way of thinking among a team of data scientists, to always be thinking about value, production, and to always strike a balance between short term progress and technical debt

Statistic about how many models get to production



In part due to adopting poor MLOps practices



What does it lead to?



Unmaintainable models

Slow ability to react 

Outdated models

Low trust in ability to tweak without breaking 

Low trust in model itself



What does good MLOps allow us to do?

What impact have we seen in the team



How are we looking to improve in future
